            <p><strong>Berkeley Phi Beta Lambda</strong> is dedicated to strengthening business leadership skills and providing opportunities for our members to foster their talents in various tasks, from creating innovative marketing campaigns to hosting large-scale events with professionals.</p>

               We believe in learning through practice. Each of our 10 committees take on unique projects each semester and will arm you with not only the tools needed to succeed in the field of your choice, but also building blocks to create your professional events.

               Despite having over 90 active members each semester, we ensure that we retain the same sort of culture that a small club would have. Joining PBL isn’t just being a member of another organization; it’s being part of a team. We study, eat, compete, travel, work, and play together and truly build a “home away from home.”

              <p>
              The Community Service Committee plays a special role in PBL by providing both social and professional opportunities for our members. Past events held by the Community Service Committee include Berkeley Project, a campus wide event that allows many other clubs to come together to help restore our community, and Springland, an event where we plan for several months canvassing and organizing to hold a carnival for over 500 underprivileged Oakland children and give them a memorable experience. We have also been involved with organizations such as KIVA ZIP and VITA that provide a glimpse of how community service and business intersect. This semester, we will be focusing on Corporate Social Responsibility and educating our members about the importance of businesses embracing a culture of community involvement. We will expose our members to the various business aspects of community service such as event planning, community outreach, and networking. Community service is a form of job enrichment that provides psychic income and a greater sense of fulfillment by forming new bonds with not just the local community but to the rest of our club. We really look forward to being your Community Service chairs this semester and we hope that our committee members truly receive the CM experience that we ourselves have developed this past year!</p>

              <p>The PBL Consulting Committee operates on a scale similar to a small consulting team of committee members as analysts and 3 co-chairs as project managers. The co-chairs will coordinate and guide the team of CM’s to help them not only become competent management consultants, but also to transform them into well-rounded elites in the business world. Through client work and presentations, CM’s will become analytical researchers, polished public speakers, and versatile problem-solvers. Early in the semester, we will focus on workshops to teach you the necessary skills to craft strong business recommendations. As the semester progresses, we will shift to real-life consulting work and tackle business problems given by our client. During this time, committee work will focus on research, followed by general recommendations and suggestions for implementation. At the end of the semester, CM’s are expected to give a presentation on their findings to the client. Our consultants come from a wide range of academic backgrounds. If you’re creative, have good analytical skills, and want to work directly with external clients, we want you!

              <p>From stocks to entrepreneurship, the PBL Finance Committee offers a comprehensive view on finance by tackling the various aspects of business. Although the Finance Committee focuses on lots of technical subjects, one of the committee’s main goals is to relate financial topics back to real life cases. As finance chairs, we will share our experiences and show you how finance is applicable to your everyday lives. By the end of the semester, committee members (CMs) are expected to not only be able to do financial analysis, but also to recognize the significance behind the figures. PBL Finance is an intermediate finance committee. However, our curriculum is designed to prepare you for higher-level finance organizations, business courses, and future opportunities.  The semester will begin with basics of finance and progress into more in depth topics and eventually end with real life case studies. CM inputs are always appreciated, and we will try to incorporate topics that CMs are interested in.</p>

              <p>Aside from helping preserve PBL’s memories throughout the semester, Historians play a crucial role in bonding the club. Although photography and cinematography are seemingly tangential in the business world, becoming a PBL Historian is an enriching experience because our photo and video projects immerse you in PBL’s social scene, develop your project and time management abilities, and leave you with the technical ability to continue creating.
              <br></br>
              As Historians, you will learn the skills and technologies that go into photography and film-making and will apply them toward engaging creative and professional projects. We will help you develop a strong creative events that will persist beyond your PBL career. After joining our committee you will be well-equipped to create lasting memories throughout your college experience and beyond. Historians gain professional and social skills through PBL’s club-wide workshops and events but also a valuable channel to showcase your creativity and artistry.</p>

              <p>The PBL professional development committee is about unlocking your potential in the professional field in business and beyond. We are here to prepare you for the next step of your professional life. Within the PBL community, PD has consistently provided training to all members in all areas of professional development whether that be resume building, interviewing, cover letters, and more. We are here to give you the skills to network and market yourself with your peers, teachers and employers. We also host a networking dinner, PBL’s largest event fall semester, Nexus, and will be working side by side with ABA.

              <p>The Social Committee is all about bringing people together! Throughout the semester, it will be Social’s job to organize and plan important events that every PBL member can enjoy and connect during. It is our hope that this semester’s events will be professional in quality and execution, and we can’t wait to see who steps up to the challenge! Our committee members this semester will plan large club-wide events including retreat and the semester-end banquet, build their presentation skills, and encourage others to reach out and bond. In addition to our CMs organizing much of PBL’s social calendar and bringing amazing events to everyone, we, as your chairs, also hope to provide our committee members with a side of professional growth. We plan to cater our professional curriculum to our committee member’s personal interests, and definitely hope that by the end of this Fall 2014 semester, our committee will have gained a greater set of professional skills as well as have found a home in PBL. To our prospective committee members, we genuinely hope y’all are as excited as we are to meet you, and we hope you all are eager to become a part of Social’s always growing family!

              <p>As our society advances to a more technologically driven world, visual design is becoming more critical in transferring ideas and messages. Businesses strive for innovative ways to communicate their products and ideas to customers and employees. This semester, the Publications Committee extends the offer to you to learn how to think like a designer. We hope to teach you the bare foundations of Adobe Creative Suite’s main visual editing software (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) and develop a sense of what makes a visual effective for communicative purposes. Our goal is not to look for the most artistically-talented minds, but rather to find people who share our enthusiasm and curiosity in graphic design. We promise our prospective committee members a fruitful semester with fun activities that will hopefully make you enjoy learning about design and spark some motivation to explore more after the semester is over. So if you want to make great connections and gain some experience using Adobe Creative Suite software, come join Publications as we join together to explore new ways to visually represent our ideas.</p>

              <h3 class="underline">Marketing</h3>

              <p>Even the most skillful marketer cannot make customers buy things they don’t want. At its core, strategic marketing is about identifying and meeting consumer needs. Marketers need to be apt at thinking both critically and creatively. They also need to be flexible enough to adapt to different industries. Which is why we decided our main focus to be on case studies this semester. Together, we will go through 6 companies in 6 different industries, each facing its own unique problem. You will have a chance to see specific applications of marketing theory, and you will learn how to research efficiently and present effectively. It is our hope that these are skills that will benefit you regardless of your major or career aspirations.On a different note, we also encourage you to get your creative juices flowing participating in the Creative Pitch Challenge! We will provide you with opportunities to network with professionals in advertising agencies and learn what makes one idea better than the other. We have a lot in store this semester, but we promise it will be a ton of fun!</p>
